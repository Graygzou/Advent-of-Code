Advent of Code 2018

### --- Day 11: Chronal Charge ---
- [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) principale : Usage of a look-up table to avoid re-computing values when iterating. Based on the memoization principale

### --- Day 12: Subterranean Sustainability ---
- Decided to work with string in order to extends/reduce the state easily and avoid dealing with dynamic arrays.
- Wrote a custom string pattern matching function in order to apply each rules directly on the current state (*string.gsub* function doesn't recognize overlapping patterns in string)
